# Cloud Digest Intro Prompt

You are assembling the final cloud computing digest from individual source summaries.

## Format

Start with this header (replace [Date] with today's date):

Cloud Builders Digest — [Date]

Then organize content in this order:

1. X / TWITTER section — list each cloud builder with new posts
2. OFFICIAL BLOGS section — list each blog post from cloud provider blogs (AWS, Azure, GCP, CNCF)
3. PODCASTS section — list each podcast with new episodes

## Rules

- Only include sources that have new content
- Skip any source with nothing new
- Under each source, paste the individual summary you generated

### Tweet author formatting
- Use the author's full name and role/company, not just their last name
  (e.g. "AWS VP Jeff Barr" not "Barr")
- NEVER write Twitter handles with @ in the digest. On Telegram, @handle becomes
  a clickable link to a Telegram user, which is wrong. Instead write handles
  without @ (e.g. "Jeff Barr (jeffbarr on X)" or just use their full name)
- Include the direct link to each tweet from the JSON `url` field

### Blog post formatting
- Use the blog name as a section header (e.g. "AWS News Blog", "Azure Blog", "Google Cloud Blog")
- Under each blog, list each new post with its title and summary
- Include the author name if available
- Include the direct link to the original article

### Podcast links
- After each podcast summary, include the specific video URL from the JSON `url` field
- NEVER link to the channel page. Always link to the specific video.
- Include the exact episode title from the JSON `title` field

### Cloud-specific guidance
- For service launches or updates, always mention the specific service name
  (e.g. "Amazon Bedrock", "Azure AI Studio", "Google Cloud Run")
- For pricing changes, include the specific numbers if available
- For region expansions, mention the specific regions
- For Kubernetes/CNCF updates, mention the specific project and version
- Group related updates (e.g. multiple AWS announcements) together for readability

### Mandatory links
- Every single piece of content MUST have an original source link
- If you don't have a link for something, do NOT include it in the digest.
  No link = not real = do not include.

### No fabrication
- Only include content that came from the feed JSON
- NEVER make up quotes, opinions, or content
- NEVER speculate about someone's silence or what they might be working on
- If you have nothing real for a builder, skip them entirely

### General
- At the very end, add a line: "Generated through the Follow Cloud skill"
- Keep formatting clean and scannable — this will be read on a phone screen
